### May 18th: Homework Review

I reviewed the homework submissions, and further comments will be sent via email. 

### May 18th: Follow the Maze Project
In this class, we continued working on the [Follow the Maze Project](./scratchProjects/3ButtonRaceFollowTheMazeHW.sjr), described on May 11th in  [homework below](#preview-for-may-18th-follow-the-maze-project). I didn't discuss the *surprise* at the end. That is a bonus question for this week.


Kids projects were full of interesting variations. Please email me your finished projects so I can look them over.

### Square Mazes

I really liked the questions kids had today. One question what how to create a nice maze, and we reviewed useful tips on how to draw straight lines, including keeping dots in the center, so that the characters have the most space to walk in: 

   * YES: ![Dots go in the center](./images/2020-05-11/DotsInTheCenter.jpg){: width="100px"}
   *  No: ![Dots go in the center](./images/2020-05-11/DotsNotLikeThis.jpg){: width="100px"}

I also explained how to make maze using "squares with holes", the 3rd kind of maze we have made so far: 

* Lines From The Edge as in the ![ "Easy Maze"](./images/2020-05-11/EasyMaze.jpg){: height="50px"}
* Linear Paths as in ![the Dragon Maze](./images/2020-04-13/Screen%20Shot%202020-04-14%20at%2011.30.36%20AM.png){:height="200px"}
* Square-with-holes, as in the ![Follow the Maze Game](./images/2020-05-11/FollowTheMazeGame.gif "Follow the maze Game"){: height="50px"}
  

Another great question was about how to make the arrows, which is shown below in the [homework for May 11th, below](#preview-for-may-18th-follow-the-maze-project), as well.

Lastly, we also talked about how to modify characters, to make buttons have the characters in them as in: ![Screen 2 of Race to the Finish](./scratchProjects/Images/Y1R25RaceToTheFinish/Game/Y1R25RacetotheFinishGame.gif "Screen 2 of Race to the Finish") 

### Next Major Project Preview: 3 Little Pigs

Most kids seem to be understanding how to use messages. We now have a basic understanding of almost all the buttons, and are ready to try more creative and advanced projects. Our next big project we will focus more on the creative side, telling stories, creating effects that help us tell the story. Our sample project will begin like this. Can you figure it out?

### May 18th Homework

This week's homework has 3 parts, but **you don't have to do them all**. 


#### Finish up projects from May 11th
* Keep working on your projects and be prepared to tell me about your project using a small description. It doesn't have to be written. The focus in on the relationship between words/stories and the code. We will do more of this next week.

#### Intro to Message Mania 

##### Warm-up: Planning for **Message Mania for 3**

Do not use scratchjr for this. Just plan it out. Write down or draw what will happen. Don't use scratchjr.

* Design 3 characters. 
  * draw them or describe them in words
* Give each character has a "receive message" block for 3 colors. For example, for character 1 (you don't have to use my example actions!!) I am writing/drawing:
  * red: say my name and introduce myself.   * 
  * orange: move to the edge of the screen and get stuck.
  * yellow: ask a question. What will the question be??
* NO action can be repeated. 

We will do it in class next week as a warmup. Did I mention not to use scratchjr for this?

##### Advanced: **Message Mania for 6**

If you are motivated, you can go to the advanced version: **Message Mania for 6**. It is the same as above but with 6 characters and colors.

#### Bonus Puzzle 
At the end of the Follow the Maze Project, the cake appears when Cat enters the last square. I used a special trick to do that. It uses Controls in a special way. Can you figure it out? Click below  for a hint:

## March 23rd

Class Outline & homework: [Introduction to the computer and ScratchJr](../lessons/jc_a_001.html)

### First Class

This class went very well. The kids were active and eager to participate. Don't forget to provide a snack for your child!!


## March 30th

Class Outline & homework: [Topic: Simple two-line maze](../lessons/jc_a_002.html)

### Thank you. Discord.
Thank you everyone for providing a snack. This week we installed Discord on all the computers, but parents will need to provide an email and password. Please write these down, as it is easy to forget.

## April 6th

Class Outline & homework: [Topic; Prep for Disappearing Dragon](../lessons/jc_a_003.html)

### Postponing the Homework

Because this class was partially a remote class, I wasn't able to fully cover the material needed for the homework, so I suggest students **postpone** the homework I assigned this time. Instead, Parents should install [Zoom](https://zoom.us/) on their device and if possible spend some time familiarizing themselves and their child with how to use it. This should include creating an account email and password. This way we can be ready for a remote class as early as next week.

### Discord to Zoom

Because of concerns about the Corona Virus this class was a combination of student's participating in person and via a Discord session. Though it was the first time doing a remote class, and as a result of patience and cooperation of students and families, I think we were able to have a successful class. However, we did notice some areas where it could be improved, and have discovered that [Zoom](https://zoom.us/)  will be able to provide us and students with a better experience. Next class we will start using Zoom. 

### Dragon Maze Demo

First, I demonstrated a ScratchJr project demonstating a character eating a cake in order to make a dragon disappear and being able to exit a maze. The purpose was to show how to use Action Blocks for making characters visible or invisible, sending messages, or initiating actions on Bumps. The rest of the class was a detailed and progressive practice in using each of these blocks by creating 4 characters who used these actions [in various ways](./../lessons/jc_a_003.md). While somewhat silly and arbitrary, the exercise was intended to help the children get ample practice using the blocks, as well as beginning to understand programing logic and sequencing. For reference I have put the details .


With these blocks described [here](./../lessons/jc_a_003.html) we have all we need to create the Disappearing Dragon Maze, which we will begin next week.

#### Making the maze

*Skill: Modifying a path in the background*

We went over how to use the select arrow to modify the path of a line in the background.

Children made a maze, where the character walks on the line, as in Black. Then they added a dragon and a cake.

They made their character walk the maze and try to eat the [dragon](hjh).

#### Tic Is Trapped!

*Skill: Sending Messages*

But the dragon sends a message:

and Tic is sent home:

###  Disappearing Dragons

*Skill: Making Characters Disappear*

Tic goes to get the cake first. The cake makes the dragon disappear.

* Cake sends a message.

* Dragon gets the message.

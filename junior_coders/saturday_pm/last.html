      <h3 id="review-agenda">Review Agenda</h3>

      <p>Today was the first day of class. The first thing I did was review what we were going to do today.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Work together mostly</li>
        <li>Learn some class rules</li>
        <li>Learn about each other</li>
        <li>Learn Special Computer words</li>
        <li>Play some games. Today a lot!</li>
        <li>Have a snack. (Please remember)</li>
        <li>Learn how to use the tablet (turn it on, off, etc.)</li>
        <li>Make sure your tablet is ready for this class</li>
        <li>Meet a robot</li>
        <li>Learn about ScratchJr</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 id="languages-we-speak">Languages we speak</h3>

      <p>We then talked about which languages we speak.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>We did a show of hands to see who speaks English, Japanese, or French. What about different combinations?
        </li>
        <li>I mentioned that in class we will use mostly English, some French, and some Japanese.</li>
        <li>I mentioned that I can also speak Portuguese and American Sign Language. One of the students speaks Korean,
          and he gave us an example.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 id="rules-expectations-what-to-do-when">Rules, Expectations, What To Do When</h3>

      <h4 id="rules">Rules</h4>
      <p>Since this was the first class, I wanted to establish some ground rules. These included:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Ask before you touch other computers.</li>
        <li>Don’t listen to videos or internet or video games unless directly related to a project and with permission.
        </li>
        <li>Make it easy for others to work: be quiet, helpful, thoughtful</li>
        <li>Treat all equipment properly and clean up carefully.</li>
        <li>Take turns when speaking.</li>
        <li>Listen when others are speaking.</li>
        <li>Make this a fun place: Be respectful. Use nice language, touch, and manners.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4 id="expectations">Expectations</h4>
      <p>I also mentioned some of my expectation for the kids, which is to say rules that help me keep the class safe
        and focused on learning and having fun.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Listen when asked. Pay attention.</li>
        <li>Do when asked. As soon as is reasonable.</li>
        <li>Do as asked. Follow directions.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4 id="procedures">Procedures</h4>
      <p>I also went over some important class procedures, and why they were there</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>When you need to go to the bathroom, go. When you get out, WASH YOUR HANDS! (Why?)</strong>
          (Obviously this one is very important)</li>
        <li>When you don’t understand, ask</li>
        <li>When you want to help, great! BUT, use words. Help without touching. (Why?)</li>
        <li>When someone helps you, listen carefully and use their good ideas. Do it yourself!</li>
        <li>When the teacher is busy, be patient.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 id="name-game">Name Game?</h3>

      <p>The first game we played was the classic “name game”. Kids were very excited and eager to meet the challenge.
        The rules were:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Say the person’s name and throw the newspaper to them.</li>
        <li>If it falls, go back to the beginning</li>
        <li>Go in the same order each time</li>
      </ul>

      <p>We did this a few times until everyone knew each other’s name (especially me) and then we did it again to try
        for speed. We didn’t go much faster, but had fun.</p>

      <h3 id="we-are-working-together">We Are Working Together</h3>

      <p>I prepared for the next game by talking about computer language. For example:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>There are <em>special Words</em> for computers</li>
        <li>Most of the <em>special words</em> are in English</li>
        <li>The meaning of <em>special words</em> is sometimes different than the usual word, for example,
          <em>mouse</em>.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 id="teacher-says">Teacher Says</h3>

      <p>We played a game whose purpose was to make sure everyone knew some basic vocabulary for user actions, and how
        to perform the actions. Since I expected to have to use this vocabulary often, I wanted to be sure the kids
        would know it. The rules were:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>If I say “Teacher Says” it means everyone does what I say.</li>
        <li>If I don’t say “Teacher Says”, no one does anything.</li>
        <li>If I don’t say it, and you do it, you have to kneel for one turn.</li>
        <li>If I say it, and you don’t do it, you have to kneel for one turn.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The kinds of vocabulary and actions we practiced were:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>First Set: Tap, Hold, Let Go</li>
        <li><strong>Tap</strong> your <em>nose</em></li>
        <li><strong>Tap</strong> your <em>nose</em> <em>2 times</em>, <em>3 times</em>, <em>4 times</em>, etc.</li>
        <li><strong>Tap</strong> <em>slowly, quickly, smoothly, roughly, soft, hard</em></li>
        <li><strong>Double Tap</strong> your nose</li>
        <li>same with <em>ear</em>, <em>knee</em>, <em>table</em>, som <em>classmate</em>, <em>computer</em></li>
        <li><strong>Tap and Hold</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Double Tap and Hold</strong></li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Let go</strong></p>
        </li>
        <li>Second Set: Drag and Scroll</li>
        <li><strong>Tap and Drag on</strong> on the table.</li>
        <li><strong>this means TAP and HOLD and DRAG and (sometimes) LET GO</strong></li>
      </ul>

      <p>In the future I plan to go over:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>scroll</strong> on the table, face, leg, etc.</li>
        <li><strong>scroll up</strong>, <strong>scroll down</strong>, <strong>scroll right</strong>, <strong>scroll
            left</strong></li>
      </ul>

      <h3 id="using-the-tablet">Using the tablet</h3>

      <p>We made sure everyone could turn the tablet on, off, and get to the Scratch program.</p>

      <h3 id="open-scratch">Open Scratch</h3>

      <p>We then started using the scratch program itself. Most of the kids knew how to open the program and start a new
        project.</p>

      <p>Once we were at the main interface.</p>
      <img src="./jc_001_scratchjrinterface.jpg" alt="scratch jr interface">
      <!-- <p><img src="./jc_001_scratchjrinterface.jpg" alt="scratchjrinterface" /></p> -->

      <p>I went over the top row of buttons.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>I also made sure they knew the yellow start button</li>
        <li>I added a few of the blue motion buttons</li>
        <li>I finished with the red stop buttons.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Once the kids were at this stage they started to have questions, and some of the things we talked about were:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>How do you change the background?</li>
        <li>How do you rotate a sprite?</li>
        <li>How do you draw lines and shapes in the sprite?</li>
        <li>How do you take a picture and use it in your background or sprite?</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 id="snack">Snack</h3>

      <p>We had a somewhat late snack, and all the kids continued working through it. At the end, kids showed off their
        original creations to the group–with some inattention :-)</p>

      <h3 id="homework">Homework</h3>

      <p>The homework assignment was to make a scratchjr. project where the sprite would walk to each corner of the view
        area when the start button is pressed.</p>

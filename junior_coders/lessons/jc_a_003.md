## Blocks practiced

These are the blocks we used in preparation for the Disappearing Dragon Maze.

### Make Characters Visible Invisible Blocks

We set up characters 1-4 who disappear: 

1. At the start
2. At the start, After they walk 5 steps 
3. At the start, after singing a song in their favorite language
4. If they are touched by another character


### Send/Receive Message Blocks

We made the characters above send messages to other characters after they disappear:

At start:
1->2: Character 1 walks 10 steps and makes character 2 reappear say "I am back" and dance,  then disappears.
3->4: Character 3 walks in a circle, says HELP, sings a song,  makes character 4 fly then disappears.

###  Trigger on Contact (Bump) Block

When Character 4 flies, she hits the ceiling, making all the characters reappear. She returns to her home.

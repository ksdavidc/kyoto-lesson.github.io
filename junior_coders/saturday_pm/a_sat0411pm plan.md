### Languages we speak

We then talked about which languages we speak.


### Rules, Expectations, What To Do When

-   Don't listen to videos or internet or video games unless directly related to a project and with permission.
-   Make it easy for others to work: be quiet, helpful, thoughtful
-   Listen when asked. Pay attention.
-   Do when asked. As soon as is reasonable.
-   Do as asked. Follow directions.

## Game: **Teacher Says**

-   There are _special Words_ for computers
-   Most of the _special words_ are in English
-   The meaning of _special words_ is sometimes different than the usual word, for example, _mouse_.

We played a game whose purpose was to make sure everyone knew some basic vocabulary for user actions, and how to perform the actions. Since I expected to have to use this vocabulary and do these actions often, I wanted to be sure the kids would know it. The rules were:

- If I say "Teacher Says" it means everyone does what I say.
- If I don't say "Teacher Says", no one does anything.
- If I don't say it, and you do it, you have to kneel for one turn.
- If I  say it, and you don't do it, you have to kneel for one turn.

The kinds of vocabulary and actions we practiced were:
-   First Set: Tap, Hold, Let Go
-   **Tap** your _nose_
-   **Tap** your _nose_ _2 times_, _3 times_, _4 times_, etc.
-   **Tap**  *slowly, quickly, smoothly, roughly, soft, hard*
-   **Double Tap** your nose
-   same with _ear_, _knee_, _screen_, som _head_, _key_
-   **Tap and Hold**
-   **Double Tap and Hold**
-   **Let go**
****
-   Second Set: Drag and Scroll
-   **Tap and Drag on** on the table.
-   **this means TAP and HOLD and DRAG and (sometimes) LET GO**

In the future I plan to go over:

-   **scroll** on the table, face, leg, etc.
-   **scroll up**, **scroll down**, **scroll right**, **scroll left**



## Using Zoom

See [Zoom Topic](../lessons/Using%20Zoom.md)

## Game: **Prep for Black**

I want to play a group game called black. To play it, we need to practice drawing 3 shapes, a cross, and two "cutout" shapes.

Let's practice. Everyone choose a different color. draw, anywhere you want. 

First I will draw the board.

### Game: **Black**

Clear the board. Play the game taking turns.

* You can choose one of the three shapes
* You must not continue the main road into the wall




## ScratchJr Intro


![scratchjrinterface](./jc_a_001_scratchjrinterface.jpg)

Review the top row of buttons.

- yellow start button
- blue motion buttons
- ed stop buttons.

Once the kids were at this stage they started to have questions, and some of the things we talked about were:

- How do you change the background?
- How do you rotate a sprite?
- How do you draw lines and shapes in the sprite?
- How do you take a picture and use it in your background or sprite?

## Homework

The homework assignment was to make a scratchjr. project where the sprite would walk to each corner of the view area when the start button is pressed.

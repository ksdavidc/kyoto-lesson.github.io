# Alien Planet

I am going to send you the [Alien Planet Project](./scratchProjects/Y1R31Alienplanet.sjr). You should be able to open in on your computer. 

Here are the codes used in the example



{:small: style="width: 80%"}
![Alien Monkey](./scratchProjects/Images/Alien%20Monkey.PNG){: small}
![Alien Cat](./scratchProjects/Images/Alien%20Cat.PNG){: small}

![Alien Sun](./scratchProjects/Images/Alien%20Sun.PNG){: small}
![Alien Ship](./scratchProjects/Images/Alien%20Ship.PNG){: small}

<br clear="all">

* Once it is open, we are going to make a similar project. 

1. You will create your own background like the one in the project. 

It can be anything you like, but at least draw several lines and use the fill tool to fill in spaces.
2. Create at least 3 and up to 8 characters. For each one:
   1. Edit the character to make them alien. Add fills, strokes, and whatever else you want.
   2. Size and place the character at their start point
3. Make each character do one or more things with the **start trigger** and the **touch trigger** and the **bump trigger**. Here are some choices: 
   2. Make the character move and dance. Use all the blue blocks.
   3. Include sounds.
   4. Make a sound for the characters and have the character make the sound, either at the beginning or when touched, or any other time.
   5. Use repeat/loop (yellow) and repeat forever (red) blocks. See the Alien Cat for an example of both.
   6. Change the speed of the character
   7. Have the character become invisible and visible. See the Alien Bat.
   8. Have the characters talk to each other. This project has no example, but we did it last time. Here is an easy example of a [Sssimple Conversation](./scratchProjects/card08-greet.pdf)

# How to send projects

When you are done, email it to me from the scratch project page (upper right corner, inside your project)! Rename it with your name, so I know who is sending it!

The 

# Knock Knock jokes.

Knock Knock jokes are traditional jokes that kids learn in English speaking countries. Have you heard of them?

They don't make any sense, but they can be funny and creative, so people like them. Don't worry that it doesn't make sense. It is just for fun. 

How do knock knock jokes work? 
Knock knock jokes all follow the same pattern. They are a conversation with 5 parts. I speak, you speak, I speak, You speak, I speak and we are finished. That's it. 5 parts. They are like mini plays or stories. 


The first two parts are always the same.

I say Knock KNock.

You say: Who's there.

Always the same. Knock Knock. Who's there. 

In fact, if someone in the US at any time, without any reason, says to you "knock knock," they will expect you to say "Who's there?" and be ready for a knock knock joke. At any time. No warning. They don't have to say, "this is a joke" or anything like that. Just "knock knock" and everyone knows it's a joke.

The 3rd part is I say something. It might be any kind of thing. It could be a name, a word, even nonsense. Just listen carefully to what I say.

Because the 4th part is you repeat part 3 to me, exactly as I said it, no changes, BUT add "who?" after it, turning it into a question.

For example, if I say "David", you say "David, who?"

If I say "Boo", you say "Boo, who?"

Let's practice. 

Dog -> Dog who? 
Sam -> Sam who?
I want to eat cheese -> I want to each cheese who?
Hugh Who?

Then I say the punch line. Now, the punch line is the joke. It will not be a "right" answer to part 4. BUt, it will be very similar to part 4, or related to it in some way. In other words, it won't make sense, but it will be funny IF you think about it in the right way. Or, in other words, you may have to know something about English, or being a kid, or something outside the joke to get the joke. Or it just may be a funny way of using the same sounds, with no meaning at all.

For example, to understand this next joke, you have to know the word for crying in English. The word is "BOO HOO". If someone says, she went "boo hoo", it means she was crying, or making sounds like she was crying. Got it? Good. Here's the joke:

Knock, knock.  
Who's There?
Boo.  
Boo hoo?  
Why are you crying?

Why is this funny? It's funny because the answer doesn't make sense. It isn't what we expected. But at the same time, in another way it makes sense because "Boo hoo" is just like "Wan Wan"; it's the sound people make when they cry, in English. See? But you have to know what "Boo Hoo" means to get the joke. But now you know it! So you I hope you can get the joke!

(Boo, by itself, is what ghosts say, but that is not related to this in any way. Boo is also what we say when we want to say we don't like something someone said or did. When the witch poisons Snow White, we say Boo. When the prince wakes her, we say YAY! But that isn't related either. It's just about the sound, and crying here.)

You can make Knock knock jokes out of almost any name. For example, Hugh has a great name for a knock know joke. Why? Because Hugh who? sounds like Yoohoo! which is what we say when we want to get someone's attention, or say hello when they are not looking at us. If you say, "Yoohoo, here I am!" I might say, "There you are. I am here too."

So here's Hugh's joke.

Knock, knock.  
Who's There?
Hugh.  
Hugh hoo.  
"There you are. I am here too."

Get it?

Akira Who? = Akila the hun  (Atilla the Hun is a famous person in history)
Anela Who? = A nail on the wall will keep your picture up!
Senosuke Who? = Say, no skiing today.
Leon who? Leon me, and I'll be your friend. (Lean on me, and I'll be your friend is part of a famous song.)
David who? The video you send me was really funny. 

Yes, they are bad, but knock knock jokes are like that. It's just fun making them up!

# Homework
Here is the [Homework Project for Knock Knock Jokes](./scratchProjects/20200427KnockKnock.sjr)
you download the file, please make sure you have the latest version of Scratchjr installed on your device. Then open the attached file and it should appear as a new project, with a blue ribbon.

The project has 4 pages. The first is complete and leads to the second. The second is for you to change with your own knock knock joke. The 3rd is missing some of the code. Can you figure out how to finish it? The last is for you to work with on your own.

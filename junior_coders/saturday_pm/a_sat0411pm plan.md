## Class Setup

### Review Agenda

* Zoom
* Class Setup
* Scratch

### Languages we speak


We then talked about which languages we speak.


### Rules, Expectations, What To Do When

-   Don't listen to videos or internet or video games unless directly related to a project and with permission.
-   Make it easy for others to work: be quiet, helpful, thoughtful
-   Listen when asked. Pay attention.
-   Do when asked. As soon as is reasonable.
-   Do as asked. Follow directions.

## Game: **Teacher Says**

-   There are _special Words_ for computers
-   Most of the _special words_ are in English
-   The meaning of _special words_ is sometimes different than the usual word, for example, _mouse_.

We played a game whose purpose was to make sure everyone knew some basic vocabulary for user actions, and how to perform the actions. Since I expected to have to use this vocabulary and do these actions often, I wanted to be sure the kids would know it. The rules were:

- If I say "Teacher Says" it means everyone does what I say.
- If I don't say "Teacher Says", no one does anything.
- If I don't say it, and you do it, you have to kneel for one turn.
- If I  say it, and you don't do it, you have to kneel for one turn.

The kinds of vocabulary and actions we practiced were:
-   First Set: Tap, Hold, Let Go
-   **Tap** your _nose_
-   **Tap** your _nose_ _2 times_, _3 times_, _4 times_, etc.
-   **Tap**  *slowly, quickly, smoothly, roughly, soft, hard*
-   **Double Tap** your nose
-   same with _ear_, _knee_, _screen_, som _head_, _key_
-   **Tap and Hold**
-   **Double Tap and Hold**
-   **Let go**
****
-   Second Set: Drag and Scroll
-   **Tap and Drag on** on the table.
-   **this means TAP and HOLD and DRAG and (sometimes) LET GO**

In the future I plan to go over:

-   **scroll** on the table, face, leg, etc.
-   **scroll up**, **scroll down**, **scroll right**, **scroll left**



## Zoom

* responding to invitation

    * Invitation may come directly to app, or by email or via a calendar reminder
    * Each meeting has a meeting id
    * It may have a password
    * you may have to choose video and audio settings
    * You may have to wait for host to let you in 
    * You may have to join audio or join video, depending on your default settings
    * You may have to mute if you are using more than one device in a room

* Once in:
    * If you don't see the controls at the bottom of the screen, tap once 

* Gallery View
    * tablet/phone: swipe to the right to see gallery view. You can see everyone in the meeting

* Speaker View
    * Double tap someone to see them
    * double tap me, and I will appear in speaker view. Is everyone looking at me?

* Meeting controls
    * Tap to see the meeting controls (in either view)
    * Tap more
    * At teh top you will see a thumbs up. Click it. A thumbs up will appear in your view. It disappears after a while.
    * Again, tap more. This time tap raise hand.
    * You should see your hand is raised. You only see your hand, but I can see everyone's hand.
    * Everyone lower your hand.

### Chat

* Receiving chats
    * If someone sends you or everyone a message, a message will appear. You can tap this to go the chat room.
    * After a while it will disappear. OH NO.
    * It's okay. A red number will appear. (remember to tap once to see your controls if you have to)

* Going to the chat screen takes 2 steps:
    * Here is the tricky part. It appears in different places depending on what kind of device you are using. 
    * On a tablet it appears on the participants icon. bottom left usually.
    * 2 steps: Tap participants. Tap chats.
    * On a phone, it is on the more icon.
    * 2 steps: Tap more. Tap chats.

* From there you can chat. Everyone send me a chat.

* You can also send each other private messages, by choosing "Send to". 

#### Game: **"What you like"**

Send a private chats. Say what you like. For example: I like sushi. I like pink. You can do anything: games, movies, books, actors, singers, bands, songs, foods, flavors of ice cream, toothpaste flavors, whatever. I like...., or I hate.... IF the person you talk to agrees, you each get one point. How many points can you get? The more people you ask or answer to, the more points you get. In 3 minutes, we will see who has the most likes.

#### Game: **Teacher Says, Zoom style**

I am going to send you each of a private message. You should do what I tell you to do, such as raise your hand, or give me a thumbs up, or clap. YOu do it. Then you pass it on to someone else. Example: I tell hikari to raise his hand. He does it.(we each get a point) Then he tells Alena to raise her hand. she does it. (You each get a point) When you get a point you tell me. Then She tells etc.

#### Game: **Teacher Says, advanced version** 

This time message everyone. We can all see the chates. I tell you to tell someone to do something. They do it. Then that person tells someone else to tell someone to do something. etc. We can see who asked and who did.

* E.g. I tell Hikari to raise his hand. If he does it, I will give you each a point. You can help each other. Then the last person sends another person a message to tell someone to do something. If that person does it, everyone in the chain gets a point! Who can get the most points! I will be be counting...I hope I can count right 


### Sharing screens

Come back to speaker view.

I am going to share a picture. Can you see it?

If you don't see the annotation controls, you may have to go to view options. 

I can clear your drawings, or everything. You can clear your own. 


## Game: **Prep for Black**

I want to play a group game called black. To play it, we need to practice drawing 3 shapes, a cross, and two "cutout" shapes.

Let's practice. Everyone choose a different color. draw, anywhere you want. 

First I will draw the board.

### Game: **Black**

Clear the board. Play the game taking turns.

* You can choose one of the three shapes
* You must not continue the main road into the wall




## ScratchJr Intro


![scratchjrinterface](./jc_a_001_scratchjrinterface.jpg)

Review the top row of buttons.

- yellow start button
- blue motion buttons
- ed stop buttons.

Once the kids were at this stage they started to have questions, and some of the things we talked about were:

- How do you change the background?
- How do you rotate a sprite?
- How do you draw lines and shapes in the sprite?
- How do you take a picture and use it in your background or sprite?

## Homework

The homework assignment was to make a scratchjr. project where the sprite would walk to each corner of the view area when the start button is pressed.

Seinosuke sent me a great Animate My Name Project. Let's all look at it. It was perfect. He did more than I asked. It is simple, easy to understand, and cute!

* This week. 

   I couldn't open the files this week for some reason. Did you do something differently? Is your program updated to the latest version? Is it from a different machine? You sent me two files with the same name. Are they different or the same. Please give each project a different name. If you want to know how, I will explain in class!

* Last week
 
  Great job! I it was really interesting with lots of fun things happening. You played a lot with visibility and invisibility in interesting ways. Cool! I have some comments and questions for you.

   * Screen 1

   Good job figuring out how to make characters normal size again. You make  ねこ and らくだ  bigger by 90. Does it really go that far? What is the highest  you can go? What is the lowest? Can you figure that out?

   ねこ gets a purple message. Who sends it?

   I like how you make らくだ disappear, then get larger and appear again. Nice!

   Cat sends an orange message. Who gets it?

   What does ほし do?

   

   * Screen 2 & 3
   
   ねこ moves right one step, then again one step. Why not just move 2 steps? Also in screen 3, he repeats motions like this. Use the numbers if you can.
   

   * Screen 4
   
   This screen is great. Very funny. I like the story.
   
   You repeat the visibility character many times with the bat. What does that do? Are you trying to use time? Is there another way?

  **Important Question**: The Cat cries out "Yobareta" when the Bat touches him, but the timing is off. Can you have the Cat act only when he is touched by the Bat.

* Project 48 

This is funny. Tell me what the pilot is doing at first. Why does he go down after being invisible?


Project 49 

* Castle

* Clever story. 

* Can you use messages to time teh events instead of timers?

Great job! 
Nice Background
Nice use of timing to make the horse and baby go at different speeds.
You used the messages perfectly.
Doesnt the horse go too far?
Why the blue message?
Nice job sending the yellow message to both characters.
why do you repeat the baby's movement 8 times, instead of moving 8 steps? Same for hte horse...

Great job. 

I really like the story of Tytin, Klistal, and Tac. Perfect use of messages to move the story forward. 
Use repeat blocks. Might be cooler with voices.
What about a 4th screen for Klistal's home.

Animate your name was great. Wonderful ideas in there.

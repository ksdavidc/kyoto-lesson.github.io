### Skills Review

We reviewed the  [skills review sample project][]. [^downloading]

[skills review sample project]: ./scratchProjects/Project120200427SkillsTest.sjr

[^downloading]: We are working with the scratchjr developers on a way to load it into ipads. For example, here is an internet link for [the Alien Planet project](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14sgXRSoC8f1d2_QEV7gBIvoWzUZ2EGI3_dw7iQp9lUU/edit), and here the [direct link to the file](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B342uiaCLSS3RGNPM1ZKeFlzb0U). Downloading it to the ipad seems to work. The tricky part is opening it on the device. Apparently on ipads, it doesn't open scratchjr the way it is supposed to.

See the [Addendum: Skill Review Checklist](#addendum-skill-review-assignment) for a checklist of the skills we reviewed . Can you do them all? You have learned a lot already!!! 


### Teacher Says with Zoom

I talked about the game [Zoom version of the Teacher Says game](../lessons/TeacherSays.html), which we played once before. In this version, I walked through the project and students sent reactions, either 1 üëç or 2 üëè, showing which button does **the next action**. Everyone did great using the zoom reaction buttons. Just using your your hands is okay too.

### Alien Planet

I showed everyone the [Alien Planet Project](./scratchProjects/Y1R31Alienplanet.sjr). We walked through some of the steps for the Alien Planet. I gave students an assignment modelled on the Alien Planet [see addendum](#addendum-alien-planet-project-checklist) . See [this addendum](#addendum-code-for-alien-planet) for the code. 

### How to send projects

When you are done, you can email it to me from the scratch project page. See the [addendum on sending projects](#addendum-sending-projects)



### Update Scratchjr

Scratchjr just updated their program. I suggest you update it on your device.

  You have learned a lot already!!! 

  Go back to [Skills Review](#skills-review)


#### Addendum: Alien Planet Project Assignment

1. Create your own background like the one in the project. It can be anything you like, but at least: 
   - [ ] draw several lines 
   - [ ] use the fill tool to fill in areas.
2. Create at least 3 and up to 8 characters. For each one:
   - [ ] Edit the character to make them alien. 
   - [ ] Add fills, strokes, and whatever else you want. 
   - [ ] Size and place the character at their start point 
3. Each character can have more than one green flag or other **trigger** at the same time. See [Alien Bat](#AlienBat). 
4. Make each character do one or more things with the **start trigger** and the **touch trigger** and the **bump trigger**. Here are some choices: 
   - [ ] Make the character move and dance. Use all the blue blocks.
   - [ ] Include sounds and speech bubbles for the characters and have the character make the sound, either at the beginning or when touched, or any other time.
   - [ ] Use repeat/loop (yellow) and repeat forever (red) blocks. See the Alien Cat for an example of both.
   - [ ] Change the speed of the character
   - [ ] Have the character become invisible and visible. See the Alien Bat.
   - [ ] Have the characters talk to each other. This project has no example, but we did it last time. Here is an easy example of a [simple conversation](./scratchProjects/card08-greet.pdf)     



#### Addendum: Sending Projects

Even though receiving projects does not seem to work on the ipad, sending does seem to work. 

1. ![upper right corner, inside your project][]
2. You should see a project page. ![the project page][]
3. Rename it with your name, so I know who is sending it!
4. Click ‚ÄùFor Parents‚Äù. 
5. You will have to solve a math problem ![a math problem][].
6. Solve it and click "Send email" ![Share by email][]

Here is the [Homework Project for Knock Knock Jokes][]
you download the file, please make sure you have the latest version of Scratchjr installed on your device. Then open the attached file and it should appear as a new project, with a blue ribbon.

The project has 4 pages. The first is complete and leads to the second. The second is for you to change with your own knock knock joke. The 3rd is missing some of the code. Can you figure out how to finish it? The last is for you to work with on your own.

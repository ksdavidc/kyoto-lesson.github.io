### Skills Review:

This class will have a review and then an individual project. First, can you use all of the skills we have used so far? 

Here is my  [skills review sample project][] [^downloading] .

[skills review sample project]: ./scratchProjects/Project120200427SkillsTest.sjr

WE will look at it together. Here is what we have learned.

- [ ] Choosing and changing the background
- [ ] adding and changing lines and shapes
- [ ] adding and making characters bigger or smaller
- [ ] making characters visible or invisible
- [ ] making characters move in different ways
- [ ] making characters act at the start, or when they are touched
- [ ] making characters speak and make sounds
- [ ] sending and receiving messages
- [ ] moving to different screens/pages

You have learned a lot!!! 


### Teacher Says Skills Review 

Now let's work on it again together. We are going to play the game [Teacher Says](../lessons/TeacherSays.html) like we did before. In this version, 

I will walk through the project.  As I go:

* I will describe **the next action**. 
* Watch my screen to see where the two icons are:

    1. One thumb up <span style="font-size:200%;">üëç</span>
    2. Two hands together <span style="font-size:200%;">üëè</span> 
* I will ask everyone or individuals to choose the correct answer. 
  
  - ONLY ANSWER IF I SAY TEACHER SAYS!!! 
  - If I say "teacher says, choose", answer. 
  - If I only say "choose", don't answer.

* When you answer, send the message for the icon which does **the next action**, either 1 üëç or 2 üëè. You can also just use your hands. I will wait until everyone has answered before giving the right answer, **so answer quickly**.


Pay attention because I may ask you at any time, and you need to know where I am. 




# Alien Planet

Here is the [Alien Planet Project](./scratchProjects/Y1R31Alienplanet.sjr). [^downloading] 

[^downloading]: We are working on a way to load it into your ipads. Here is the internet link for [describing the project](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14sgXRSoC8f1d2_QEV7gBIvoWzUZ2EGI3_dw7iQp9lUU/edit), and here the [direct link to the file](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B342uiaCLSS3RGNPM1ZKeFlzb0U). Downloading it to your device is easy. The tricky part is opening it on your device. Apparently on ipads, it doesn't open scratchjr the way it is supposed to.



I wish I could send it to you. You can try to download it from google, but it may not work...

#### Questions for Alien Planet

* Why doesn't the sun spin forever?
* Why doesn't the alien ship forever move, hide, and show?
* Why doesn't the alien ball spin, move, and make a sound all at the same time?



* Once it is open, we are going to make a similar project. 

[class note: perform each step and come back to me.]

1. You will create your own background like the one in the project. It can be anything you like, but at least: 
   - [ ] draw several lines and 
   - [ ] use the fill tool to fill in spaces.
2. Create at least 3 and up to 8 characters. For each one:
   - [ ] Edit the character to make them alien. Add fills, strokes, and whatever else you want.
   - [ ] Size and place the character at their start point
3. Make each character do one or more things with the **start trigger** and the **touch trigger** and the **bump trigger**. Here are some choices: 
   - [ ] Make the character move and dance. Use all the blue blocks.
   - [ ] Include sounds and speech bubbles for the characters and have the character make the sound, either at the beginning or when touched, or any other time.
   - [ ] Use repeat/loop (yellow) and repeat forever (red) blocks. See the Alien Cat for an example of both.
   - [ ] Change the speed of the character
   - [ ] Have the character become invisible and visible. See the Alien Bat.
   - [ ] Have the characters talk to each other. This project has no example, but we did it last time. Here is an easy example of a [simple conversation](./scratchProjects/card08-greet.pdf)     


### How to send projects

When you are done, email it to me from the scratch project page

1. ![upper right corner, inside your project][]
2. You should see a project page. ![the project page][]
3. Rename it with your name, so I know who is sending it!
4. Click ‚ÄùFor Parents‚Äù. 
5. You will have to solve a math problem ![a math problem][].
6. Solve it and click "Send email" ![Share by email][]

### Knock Knock jokes.

Knock Knock jokes are traditional jokes that kids learn in English speaking countries. Have you heard of them?

They don't make any sense, but they can be funny and creative, so people like them. Don't worry that it doesn't make sense. It is just for fun. 

How do knock knock jokes work? 
Knock knock jokes all follow the same pattern. They are a conversation with 5 parts. I speak, you speak, I speak, You speak, I speak and we are finished. That's it. 5 parts. They are like mini plays or stories. 


The first two parts are always the same.

I say Knock KNock.

You say: Who's there.

Always the same. Knock Knock. Who's there. 

In fact, if someone in the US at any time, without any reason, says to you "knock knock," they will expect you to say "Who's there?" and be ready for a knock knock joke. At any time. No warning. They don't have to say, "this is a joke" or anything like that. Just "knock knock" and everyone knows it's a joke.

The 3rd part is I say something. It might be any kind of thing. It could be a name, a word, even nonsense. Just listen carefully to what I say.

Because the 4th part is you repeat part 3 to me, exactly as I said it, no changes, BUT add "who?" after it, turning it into a question.

For example, if I say "David", you say "David, who?"

If I say "Boo", you say "Boo, who?"

Let's practice. 

Dog -> Dog who? 
Sam -> Sam who?
I want to eat cheese -> I want to each cheese who?
Hugh Who?

Then I say the punch line. Now, the punch line is the joke. It will not be a "right" answer to part 4. BUt, it will be very similar to part 4, or related to it in some way. In other words, it won't make sense, but it will be funny IF you think about it in the right way. Or, in other words, you may have to know something about English, or being a kid, or something outside the joke to get the joke. Or it just may be a funny way of using the same sounds, with no meaning at all.

For example, to understand this next joke, you have to know the word for crying in English. The word is "BOO HOO". If someone says, she went "boo hoo", it means she was crying, or making sounds like she was crying. Got it? Good. Here's the joke:

Knock, knock.  
Who's There?
Boo.  
Boo hoo?  
Why are you crying?

Why is this funny? It's funny because the answer doesn't make sense. It isn't what we expected. But at the same time, in another way it makes sense because "Boo hoo" is just like "Wan Wan"; it's the sound people make when they cry, in English. See? But you have to know what "Boo Hoo" means to get the joke. But now you know it! So you I hope you can get the joke!

(Boo, by itself, is what ghosts say, but that is not related to this in any way. Boo is also what we say when we want to say we don't like something someone said or did. When the witch poisons Snow White, we say Boo. When the prince wakes her, we say YAY! But that isn't related either. It's just about the sound, and crying here.)

You can make Knock knock jokes out of almost any name. For example, Hugh has a great name for a knock know joke. Why? Because Hugh who? sounds like Yoohoo! which is what we say when we want to get someone's attention, or say hello when they are not looking at us. If you say, "Yoohoo, here I am!" I might say, "There you are. I am here too."

So here's Hugh's joke.

Knock, knock.  
Who's There?
Hugh.  
Hugh hoo.  
"There you are. I am here too."

Get it?

Akira Who? = Akkila the hun  (Attila the Hun is a famous person in history)
Anela Who? = A nail on the wall will keep your picture up!
Senosuke Who? = Say, no skiing today.
Leon who? Leon me, and I'll be your friend. (Lean on me, and I'll be your friend is part of a famous song.)
David who? The video you send me was really funny. 

Yes, they are bad, but knock knock jokes are like that. It's just fun making them up!

### Homework
Keep working on Alien and Knock Knock. Email the result.


<!-- 



Here is the [Homework Project for Knock Knock Jokes][]
you download the file, please make sure you have the latest version of Scratchjr installed on your device. Then open the attached file and it should appear as a new project, with a blue ribbon.

The project has 4 pages. The first is complete and leads to the second. The second is for you to change with your own knock knock joke. The 3rd is missing some of the code. Can you figure out how to finish it? The last is for you to work with on your own.

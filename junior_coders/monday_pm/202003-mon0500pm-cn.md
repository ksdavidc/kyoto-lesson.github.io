### 23rd March

Class notes & homework: [001 Introduction to the computer and ScratchJr](../lessons/jc_001.html)

This class went very well. The kids were active and eager to participate. Don't forget to provide a snack for your child!!


### 30th March

Class notes & homework: [002 Simple two-line maze](../lessons/jc_002.html)

Thank you everyone for providing a snack. This week we installed Slack on all the computers, but parents will need to provide an email and password. Please write these down, as it is easy to forget.

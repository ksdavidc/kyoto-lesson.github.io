## April 4th

### Animate My name

I had students make their own project based on the [Bootup Animate My Name](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQzWGY4xuSY) project, which you can [download here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B342uiaCLSS3YzJTUmlha1FQRjF1cldPdjQtUVhGUjFROEFz). Students created characters based on teh letters in their name. 
We talked about what each letter was doing. Then students created their own.

As a follow, we changed it so instead of all the characters moving at once, they moved in turn. Some kids got creative and had the letters say things and do funny things along the way.

### Student Homework Notes

I went over last week's homework with the students. I gave each student some next steps to keep working on. The most common thing was to make the conversations longer and go back and forth.

#### Anela

* I like how you used the repeat blocks in caty. I like the funny sounds. I like that the characters are sending each other messages.
* When ryre starts she moves around and then says OH NO. Then she talks to klistal, who does a dance and screams...can you make klistal continue talking to ryre? this into more of a story. 
* When I touch ryre, she disappears, appears, and then sends a blue message. But the things after that never happen? Why? How could you fix that?
* It is interesting that klistal is invisible when she speaks. We don'T know who is talking...Did you do that on purpose? 
* If I touch ryre, she sends a message to roronb, who says "stop it". We don't know why he is saying that. Can you make that clearer? What is ryre doing to roronb?
* I am a small robot. Mom or Ma'am?


#### Akira 
* I like how you switch screens. 
* On the second screen, the cat says let's dance and everyone says ok at the same time. That's cool. 
* I like how the characters take turns dancing.
* Why does Cat Walking get visible twice? Is he ever invisible?
* Why Does the cat on the second screen never speak the sounds: "let's dance"
* The dance ends suddenly. Can you think of an ending?


#### Hugh

* I like your interesting character and faces.
* I like that each character moves a little differently. 
* Use the numbers at the bottom of the movement blocks instead of repeating a block
* After the fish talks, what does Tic say? Can you continue the conversation?
* The actions now are a little random. Can you make them more meaningful? 
  * Why does "Character" go back and forth? Why does he go up down and turn? 
  * What does the second "Character" do?
  * For every action, give them something to say: 
    * If he is looking for something:
      * Where is my rocket? Is he over here? Is it around the corner?
* More things for you characters to do:
  * They meet, and talk. Talk about what???
  * They chase each other. Is one of them angry? Are they playing tag.
  * One bumps into another and the other reacts. How does he react?

#### Leon 

* Nice use of speed in Chat's actions. But why is he moving that way? Why does it repeat forever? Can you mke him stop? 
* Why not include the speed in the 
* Why does the monkey have two green flag triggers? Could you combine them? What is the difference in the order?
* 


### Speed practice

* Cat goes slow then quick then slow
* Why does HughPig go fast the second time? Even if I close and reopen the program! Can I fix this?
* Why doesn't this happen to Hughcat?
* What is happening with Hugh Horse. Notice how he speeds up and slows down. Notice how I use the clock




### Homework Part 1: Keep working on Alien Planet

Continue adding and revising Alien Planet. THink about:

* Make the characters talk to each other. Try to turn it into a story. 
* Make the character's actions meaningful.


### Homework Part 2: A Story Based on the Hare and Tortoise

#### Instructions
* You can find a [movie here: ](./images/2020-05-04/Homeworkfor05-11.mov)
* Just do the first part unless you want to do more. The rest we can do in class.
* You can use regular scratch backgrounds, or make your own.
* Choose any characters, or make your own.
* I have made a simple script, but **you can use your own**. 
* Blocks you will need: Start trigger, speech, movement, speed, etc.
* Use messages to make the characters speak in turn. 
* Control the speed of the characters. 
* You can make the characters walk in funny ways.

#### Screenplay
1. The Character2 and the Character1 introduce themselves and decide to have a race
   1. Background: the entrance to the race
   2. Characters: Character1, Character2, Character3, OTher Characters
   3. Script:
      Character1: You are slow. I am the fastest.
      Character2: Actually, I am faster than you. Let's race!
      Character1: Yeah? Okay, let's race.
      Character3: I will be the judge. When I say, go, start running.
      Character3: Ready...Steady....Go
      *Character2 runs slowly, and the Character1 runs quickly off the screen. When he does he disappears we go to the next screen.*

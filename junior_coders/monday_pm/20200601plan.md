### Message Mania Part 1

We ran through the Message Mania HW assignment.  The purpose of the HW was to:

* Plan/think about the story before you code it. That is why the assignment was NOT to do it in ScratchJr.

My explanation was poor. I blame Zoom ;-) 

Many children did this: 

* One character has: Green flag, orange message, red message, yellow message.

What I wanted was:

* Each character has a green flag. No message. Messages will be sent by Buttons.
* Each character receives 3 messages
* Each reactions is a different type

The purpose of the project was:

* to show that messages can go to more than one character at a time. 
* to continue getting practice coding messages and buttons.
* Clicking a button can make several characters move at once.
* Help some students use Messages instead of Wait buttons to control sequence and timing. 

I will post a samole project here later in the week.



### Message Mania Part 2

Messages can happen one after the other, such as this common code:

* One character has: Green flag, orange message, red message, yellow message.
* Each message go to one character. Tick does the orange. Tac does the red. Cat does the yellow.

Messages also happen like this.

* Every character has their own green flag.
* Messages are sent to more than one character. 
* Message Mania was many of this pattern happening all at the same time. 



I didn't get to explaining this to students (Zoom is tough), but we'll work on it again in person.



* The character gets the message, and sends another color message to a different character.
* That character sends the next message.

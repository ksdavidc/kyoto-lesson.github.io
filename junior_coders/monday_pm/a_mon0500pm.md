## March 23rd: First Class

Class Outline & homework: [Introduction to the computer and ScratchJr](../lessons/jc_a_001.html)


This class went very well. The kids were active and eager to participate. Don't forget to provide a snack for your child!!


## March 30th: Thank you. Discord.

Class Outline & homework: [Simple two-line maze](../lessons/jc_a_002.html)

Thank you everyone for providing a snack. This week we installed Discord on all the computers, but parents will need to provide an email and password. Please write these down, as it is easy to forget.

## April 4th: Prep for Disappearing Dragon

Class Outline & homework: [Prep for Disappearing Dragon](../lessons/jc_a_003.html)


### Postponing the Homework

Because this class was partially a remote class, I wasn't able to fully cover the material needed for the homework, so I suggest students **postpone** the homework I assigned this time. Instead, Parents should install [Zoom](https://zoom.us/) on their device and if possible spend some time familiarizing themselves and their child with how to use it. This should include creating an account email and password. This way we can be ready for a remote class as early as next week.

### Moving from Discord to Zoom

Because of concerns about the Corona Virus this class was a combination of student's participating in person and via a Discord session. Though it was the first time doing a remote class, and as a result of patience and cooperation of students and families, I think we were able to have a successful class. However, we did notice some areas where it could be improved, and have discovered that [Zoom](https://zoom.us/)  will be able to provide us and students with a better experience. Next class we will start using Zoom. 

### Disappearing Dragon Maze Demo

First, I demonstrated a ScratchJr project demonstating a character eating a cake in order to make a dragon disappear and being able to exit a maze. The purpose was to show how to use Action Blocks for making characters visible or invisible, sending messages, or initiating actions on Bumps. The rest of the class was a detailed and progressive practice in using each of these blocks by creating 4 characters who used these actions [in various ways](./../lessons/jc_a_003.md). While somewhat silly and arbitrary, the exercise was intended to help the children get ample practice using the blocks, as well as beginning to understand programing logic and sequencing. For reference I have put the details .


With these blocks described [here](./../lessons/jc_a_003.html) we have all we need to create the Disappearing Dragon Maze, which we will begin next week.

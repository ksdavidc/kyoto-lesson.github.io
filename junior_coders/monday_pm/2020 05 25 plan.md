### Message Mania

Run through the project.

* Design 3 characters. 
  * draw them or describe them in words
* Give each character has a "receive message" block for 3 colors. For example, for character 1 (you don't have to use my example actions!!) I am writing/drawing:
  * red: say my name and introduce myself.   * 
  * orange: move to the edge of the screen and get stuck.
  * yellow: ask a question. What will the question be??
* NO action can be repeated.

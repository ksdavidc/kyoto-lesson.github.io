* [Teacher Says](#teacher-says)


## Teacher Says


We played a game whose purpose was to make sure everyone knew some basic vocabulary for user actions, and how to perform the actions. Since I expected to have to use this vocabulary often, I wanted to be sure the kids would know it. The rules were:
- If I say "Teacher Says" it means everyone does what I say.
- If I don't say "Teacher Says", no one does anything.
- If I don't say it, and you do it, you have to kneel for one turn.
- If I  say it, and you don't do it, you have to kneel for one turn.

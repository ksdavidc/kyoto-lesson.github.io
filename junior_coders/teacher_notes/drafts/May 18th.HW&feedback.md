# Homework & Feedback

## Everyone

Great job everyone on last weeks on the Follow the maze. Keep working on your projects and **send them in to me** if you can, so I can review them.

Our next big project we will focus on telling stories and creating effects that help us tell the story. 

See [the class page](https://kyoto-lesson.github.io/junior_coders/monday_pm/a_mon0500pm.html#may-18th-homework) for more info about this week's homework, including Message Mania! and 3 little pigs.

Here are some very rough comments I wrote down on projects you sent me recently (May 4th and 11th). Some of these we talked about in class. I am working on having a better system for reviewing projects, so bear with this. It will get better.

## Anela

### Anela May 4th Homework. The Race. 
Great job. 

I really like the story of Tytin, Klistal, and Tac. Perfect use of messages to move the story forward. 
Use repeat blocks. Might be cooler with voices.
What about a 4th screen for Klistal's home.

Animate your name was great. Wonderful ideas in there.

* Project 48 

This is funny. Tell me what the pilot is doing at first. Why does he go down after being invisible?


* Project 49 

Castle is great

Clever story. 

Can you use messages to time the events instead of timers?

#### Leon . May 4th The Race
Great job! 
Nice Background
Nice use of timing to make the horse and baby go at different speeds.
You used the messages perfectly.
Doesn't the horse go too far?
Why the blue message?
Nice job sending the yellow message to both characters.
Why do you repeat the baby's movement 8 times, instead of moving 8 steps? Same for the horse...

NIce how they go at different speeds

#### next 
add a finish line. What happens when they reach the finish line

* This week. 

   I couldn't open the files this week for some reason. Did you do something differently? Is your program updated to the latest version? Is it from a different machine? You sent me two files with the same name. Are they different or the same. Please give each project a different name. If you want to know how, I will explain in class!

* Last week
 
  Great job! I it was really interesting with lots of fun things happening. You played a lot with visibility and invisibility in interesting ways. Cool! I have some comments and questions for you.

   * Screen 1

   Good job figuring out how to make characters normal size again. You make  ねこ and らくだ  bigger by 90. Does it really go that far? What is the highest  you can go? What is the lowest? Can you figure that out?

   ねこ gets a purple message. Who sends it?

   I like how you make らくだ disappear, then get larger and appear again. Nice!

   Cat sends an orange message. Who gets it?

   What does ほし do?

   

   * Screen 2 & 3
   
   ねこ moves right one step, then again one step. Why not just move 2 steps? Also in screen 3, he repeats motions like this. Use the numbers if you can.
   

   * Screen 4
   
   This screen is great. Very funny. I like the story.
   
   You repeat the visibility character many times with the bat. What does that do? Are you trying to use time? Is there another way?

  **Important Question**: The Cat cries out "Yobareta" when the Bat touches him, but the timing is off. Can you have the Cat act only when he is touched by the Bat.

* screen 1
they all move. 
now let's make the cat control the penguin and the frog control teh monkey?

why does he never stop speaking?

Can the Cat control the penguin

#### next

Screen 2: Make frog control monkey. Add a finish line. What happens when they reach the finish line?

Can you make a button. Use a character as a model, and then paint him. See my cat. Do the same for frog.

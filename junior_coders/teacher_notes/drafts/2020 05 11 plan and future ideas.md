##### H&T. Instructions for Part 1 recap
* The goal is to create a similar project by yourself.
* You can download the [movie here](./images/2020-05-04/Homeworkfor05-11.gif). It is just an example.
* You can use regular scratch backgrounds, or make your own.
* Choose any characters, or **make your own**.
* I have made a sample "screenplay" (below), but **you can use your own**. 
* Use messages to make the characters speak **in turn**. 
* Control the speed of the characters. 
* You can make the characters walk in funny ways.
* My horse is in the tree. Where do you think the characters should be placed? 

##### H&T. Sample Screenplay for Part 1 recap

### May 11th Zoom Issues

Apologies if you had problems getting my attention after I muted everyone. I was trying to control background noise by muting everyone and turning people back on. It wasn't so successful. Sorry.

It is difficult to keep background noise down. If you are having a side conversation or you have background noise in your house, it is helpful to mute your microphone so others don't hear it. Then, if you want to speak turn it back on again. 

Sometimes I am paying attention to one student, and the part of my screen that shows students or incoming chats may not be visible. Please keep trying. This is just a limitation of doing remote classes. 

### Main Idea: Control Buttons 

The main idea of this class was **Control Buttons**. Control buttons make one character control another character.

Screen 1 of the [3ButtonRaceFollowTheMaze Sample Project](./scratchProjects/3ButtonRaceFollowTheMazeHW.sjr) gives an example. It also has a simple exercise for you to do if you think you need more practice. It is a 2 step process. Here is what to do:

1. Make the button. It can be anything. 

   * When you touch the CONTROLLER it sends a message. Add this:

![Monkey Controls Frog](./images/2020-05-11/ControlButtonsMonkeySendsGreen.jpg "Monkey Controls Frog")

2. Go to the character that receives that message. 

   * When THE CONTROLLED gets the message, it acts. Add this:

![Frog is controlled by Monkey](./images/2020-05-11/ControlButtonsFrogisControlled.jpg "Frog is controlled by Monkey")


That's it!!! 

In the sample project, **Monkey** controls **Frog**, and **Penguin** controls Cat. 

If you need practice, try to make the **Flag** control **Tac**. 

In class, we made a the Race to the Finish Game. It had 2 controls. The CAT BUTTON controlled the **Cat**, the BIRD BUTTON controlled the **Bird**. Could you do it? Look at it again and fix it if you have to.



### May 11th Homework: Preview for May 18th
In the next class, we will make 4 controls for one character. They will make the character move up, down, right, and left. Here is a picture. Can you figure out how it works?

* I made one **Arrow**. Then I copied it and rotated it to make the other 3:

![Making an Arrow Control](./images/2020-05-11/MakingAnArrowControl.gif)

* Then I added code for EACH **Arrow**. This is the part that makes it work:

![Making the Up Button](./images/2020-05-11/UpButtonWorks.gif)

#### May 11th Homework: Finish the controls

Your Homework is to make the other **Arrows** work.

1. Use different color messages
2. Make the controls a little smaller 
3. Add a Maze

Now you have a **Follow the Maze Game** (It's **Screen 2** of [The 3ButtonRaceFollowTheMaze Project](./scratchProjects/3ButtonRaceFollowTheMazeHW.sjr)! 

Easy Peasy! 

Here is my finished one. It has an extra twist at the end. 

![Follow the maze Game](./images/2020-05-11/FollowTheMazeGame.gif "Follow the maze Game")


* Can you figure out how the **Cake** appears?
* Use this kind of maze if you want it simple.


* Here's a useful tip. When you adjust the dots/lines for your maze, make the dots in the center of the light grey grid, not on the lines of the grid.

* Like this: ![Dots go in the center](./images/2020-05-11/DotsInTheCenter.jpg){: width="100px"}
*  Not like this: ![Dots go in the center](./images/2020-05-11/DotsNotLikeThis.jpg){: width="100px"}


### Another example: Race to the Finish

#### Race to the Finish. Opening 

Here is the [Race to the Finish Project](scratchProjects/Y1R25RacetotheFinish.sjr)

![](./scratchProjects/Images/Y1R25RaceToTheFinish/Story/Y1R25RacetotheFinish.gif) 


Can you recreate the race to the finish?



#### Race to the Finish Game. 

Let's turn The Race to the Finish into a game you can play


Here is the [Race to the Finish Game](scratchProjects/Y1R25RacetotheFinishGame.sjr)

![](./scratchProjects/Images/Y1R25RaceToTheFinish/Game/Y1R25RacetotheFinishGame.gif) 

Notice that when I click the green boxes, teh characters move to the right one step.

How to play? 


### Hare and Tortoise (H&T), Part 1. May 4th Homework Review 

Great Job everyone. 



##### H&T. May 4th Homework Student Reviews

###### 

### H&T, Part 2

Let's continue the story. Watch the sample and look at the script below. Ask questions. 

2. The Character1 runs fast and the Character2 runs slow
   1. Background: We can see the whole course. The course is a maze. A small Character1 and Character2 run along it from the top left to the bottom right. At the bottom right is a river.
   2. Characters: Character1 and Character2
   3. Simplified script: 
      *Character1 goes fast, Character2 runs slow along the maze.* 
      *When Character1 gets to the bottom right, he stops at the bottom and says* 
      I am winning. I see a river. The river is beautiful. 
      *He goes off the path and walks to the river.*


### H&T, Part 3

3. Character1 decides to take a nap near a river. Character2 catches up to him.
   1. background: a riverbed.
   2. Characters: Character1 and Character2.
   3. Script: 
      *Character1 comes up to the river. We hear him yawn.*
      Character1: I am sleepy. I will take a nap.
      *He snores. After a while Character1 comes in and looks at him and says:* 
      Character2: That Character1 is silly. I will keep on running.
      *Character2 leaves. After he leaves, Character1 wakes up. He yawns. Then he says:* 
      Character1: That was a nice nap. Now to finish the race.


### H&T, Part 4

4. Character2 races past the Character1 and wins the race
   1. Background: finish line of the race. 
   2. Character1, Character2, Character3, Other Characters.
   3. Script:
      Character3: Here comes the Character2. He is going to win.
      *Character2 comes up and finishes the race.* 
      Character3: The Character2 wins.
      Other Characters: Hooray! Good Job! Fantastic! 
      *Character1 arrives. He stops. He sees Character2 has won and says:* 
      Character1: I was too proud and I lost. It's a lesson to me. 
      *The end*



### Message Mania for 6

6 characters. Each character has a "receive message" block for each color. For example, for character 1:
- [ ] orange: move to the edge of the screen
- [ ] red: say my name
- [ ] yellow : ask a question
- [ ] blue : spin around
- [ ] purple : get bigger then burp then burst and become smaller
- [ ] green : turn around and fly away while screaming wheeee

NO action can be repeated. 
You must use blue blocks, purple blocks, orange blocks, red blocks.

Then add a send message when touched block to each character. Each character must send a different color message.

#### Easier version: Message Mania for 3

Same as above but only 3 characters and 3 colors.

### 3 Little Pigs in Scratch

One action per sentence:

Once upon a time:,
1. There were 3 pigs
2. The wolf destroyed the 1st 
3. and second house
4. The wolf couldn't destroy the last house

### Knock Knock jokes.

1. Explain Jokes.
   1. Have group work through a couple
   2. Send jokes to individuals and have them run through them.


Knock Knock jokes are traditional jokes that kids learn in English speaking countries. Have you heard of them?

They don't make any sense, but they can be funny and creative, so people like them. Don't worry that it doesn't make sense. It is just for fun. 

How do knock knock jokes work? 
Knock knock jokes all follow the same pattern. They are a conversation with 5 parts. I speak, you speak, I speak, You speak, I speak and we are finished. That's it. 5 parts. They are like mini plays or stories. 

The first two parts are always the same.

I say Knock Knock.

You say: Who's there.

Always the same. Knock Knock. Who's there. 

<!-- In fact, if someone in the US at any time, without any reason, says to you "knock knock," they will expect you to say "Who's there?" and be ready for a knock knock joke. At any time. No warning. They don't have to say, "this is a joke" or anything like that. Just "knock knock" and everyone knows it's a joke.
 -->

The 3rd part is I say something. It might be any kind of thing. It could be a name, a word, even nonsense. Just listen carefully to what I say.

Because the 4th part is you repeat part 3 to me, exactly as I said it, no changes, BUT add "who?" after it, turning it into a question.

For example, if I say "David", you say "David, who?"

If I say "Boo", you say "Boo, who?"

Let's practice. 

Dog -> Dog who? 
Sam -> Sam who?
I want to eat cheese -> I want to each cheese who?
Hugh Who?

Then I say the punch line. Now, the punch line is the joke. It will not be a "right" answer to part 4. BUt, it will be very similar to part 4, or related to it in some way. In other words, it won't make sense, but it will be funny IF you think about it in the right way. 

Or, in other words, you may have to know something about English, or being a kid, or something outside the joke to get the joke. Or it just may be a funny way of using the same sounds, with no meaning at all. 

For example, to understand this next joke, you have to know the word for crying in English. The word is "BOO HOO". If someone says, she went "boo hoo", it means she was crying, or making sounds like she was crying. Got it? Good. Here's the joke:

Knock, knock.  
Who's There?
Boo.  
Boo hoo?  
Why are you crying?

Why is this funny? It's funny because the answer doesn't make sense. It isn't what we expected. But at the same time, in another way it makes sense because "Boo hoo" is just like "Wan Wan"; it's the sound people make when they cry, in English. See? But you have to know what "Boo Hoo" means to get the joke. But now you know it! So you I hope you can get the joke!

(Boo, by itself, is what ghosts say, but that is not related to this in any way. Boo is also what we say when we want to say we don't like something someone said or did. When the witch poisons Snow White, we say Boo. When the prince wakes her, we say YAY! But that isn't related either. It's just about the sound, and crying here.)

You can make Knock knock jokes out of almost any name. For example, Hugh has a great name for a knock know joke. Why? Because Hugh who? sounds like Yoohoo! which is what we say when we want to get someone's attention, or say hello when they are not looking at us. If you say, "Yoohoo, here I am!" I might say, "There you are. I am here too."

So here's Hugh's joke.

Knock, knock.  
Who's There?
Hugh.  
Hugh hoo.  
"There you are. I am here too."

Get it?

Akira Who? = Akkila the hun  (Attila the Hun is a famous person in history)
Anela Who? = A nail on the wall will keep your picture up!
Senosuke Who? = Say, no skiing today.
Leon who? Leon me, and I'll be your friend. (Lean on me, and I'll be your friend is part of a famous song.)
David who? The video you send me was really funny. 

Yes, they are bad, but knock knock jokes are like that. It's just fun making them up!

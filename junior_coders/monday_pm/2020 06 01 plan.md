### Message Mania Part 2


Messages can happen one after the other, such as this common code:

* One character has: Green flag, orange message, red message, yellow message.
* Messages go to one character. Tick does the orange. Tac does the red. Cat does the yellow.

Messages also happen like this.

* Every character has their own green flag.
* Messages are sent to more than one character. 
* Message Mania was many of this pattern happening all at the same time. 



I didn't get to explaining this to students (Zoom is tough), but we'll work on it again in person.



* The character gets the message, and sends another color message to a different character.
* That character sends the next message.

### 23rd March Notes

To see the class plan, go to [Class 1 Plan](../lessons/jc_001.html)

This class went very well. The kids were active and eager to participate. Don't forget to provide a snack for your child!!


### 30th March

Thank you everyone for providing a snack. This week we installed Slack on all the computers, but parents will need to provide an email and password. Please write these down, as it is easy to forget. Also, don't forget to check out this week's [homework](../lessons/jc_002.html)

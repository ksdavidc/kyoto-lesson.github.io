## Homework

The homework was to make a conversation by sending message back and forth between characters. If you need something for the characters to say, [here](../lessons/JokesForBadJokes.md) are some jokes to use.

## Hugh and Akira almost had the Dragon Maze solved.

Hugh and Akira worked very hard on the Dragon Maze, but they had a problem. I have made special [Dragon Maze Part 2](../lessons/DragonMazePart2.md) directions on making the Dragon maze work. The directions are very detailed, so take it slow. If you have questions, we will go over it in class next week.
